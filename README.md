# Nim cryptographic library

Nimcrypto is Nim's cryptographic library. It implements several popular cryptographic algorithms and their tests with some [examples](https://github.com/cheatfate/nimcrypto/tree/master/examples).
  
Most notably, this library has been used in the [Nimbus Ethereum client](https://our.status.im/nimbus-for-newbies/). To see the implementation, check out its [Github repository](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2).


## The most basic usage

```bash
nimble install nimcrypto # installation
```

```nim
# example.nim
import nimcrypto

echo keccak_256.digest("Alice makes a hash") 
# outputs F8AE86DA35CF3D9F0816BAA6015A6AFFD20BA5D6A533FEA94D89D6164264326F
```
